A modular Discord bot for a private community server. Built with TypeScript on Discord.js v14 with PostgreSQL persistence, database-backed configuration, a local REST API, and a dashboard platform.

The bot handles general interactions, voice channel automation, moderation, member logging, and generates custom welcome and goodbye cards. All runtime settings are configurable without code changes via the database.

**Dashboard**: The platform, Discord OAuth login, and server-side sessions are implemented but intentionally not deployed. Public deployment is blocked until reverse proxy and production security hardening are completed.

## Features

### General
- Slash commands (`/ping`, `/help`)
- Case-insensitive prefix commands (`hoakping`, `hoakhelp`, `hoakp`)
- Shared command registry with alias support

### Voice
- Automatically joins a configured standby voice channel on startup
- Follows members to their channel and plays a configurable sound, then returns to standby
- 6-state machine: `IDLE` → `MOVING` → `WAITING` → `PLAYING` → `RETURNING` → `COOLDOWN`
- Cooldown protection and exponential backoff reconnection

### Logging
- Voice join, leave, and move logging with embeds
- Member profile change logging (nickname, display name, avatar, roles)
- Message deletion, editing, and bulk deletion
- Moderation action logging (kick, ban, timeout, warn, clean)

### Moderation
- `/kick`, `/ban`, `/timeout`, `/warn`, `/clean` commands
- Role-based permission levels (admin, moderator, trusted)
- Persistent warning system with database storage

### Welcome & Goodbye
- Custom welcome cards with configurable backgrounds, templates, Unicode fonts
- Custom goodbye cards with the same system
- Template variables (`{mention}`, `{server}`, `{membercount}`)
- Three-tier background fallback (configured → bundled default → solid color)
- Auto-scaling for long usernames
- Font stack: Noto Sans, Noto Sans CJK JP, Noto Color Emoji

### Core Platform
- Lightweight dependency injection container
- Internal EventBus with typed events
- Database-backed `ConfigurationService` with JSON file fallback
- Schema-validated settings (Zod) with per-guild storage
- Metadata-driven settings registry for UI rendering
- Live configuration without restart (event bus + runtime mutation)
- Structured logging via Pino (JSON output in production)
- PostgreSQL adapter with connection pooling (Supabase)
- Subsystem health checks with startup summary
- In-process metrics (counters, gauges, timers)
- Module-based architecture with feature flags
- Bounded image cache (max 20 entries)
- Global crash handlers (`unhandledRejection`, `uncaughtException`)
- Localhost-only REST API in production

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js 22 |
| Language | TypeScript 5.9 |
| Discord | discord.js v14, @discordjs/voice |
| Database | PostgreSQL (postgres) |
| Canvas | @napi-rs/canvas |
| Validation | Zod |
| Logging | Pino |
| Process | PM2 |
| Dashboard | React 19, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS 4, Vitest |

---

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- npm
- A Discord Bot Application with token (see [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase or self-hosted)
- PM2 (for production deployment)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erastus-hs/hoakbot.git
cd hoakbot
npm install
```

### Configuration

Secrets and environment variables are configured in `.env`. Copy the template and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your secrets. Runtime configuration (prefix, voice channels, templates) is stored in the database via the dashboard API. The `config/bot.json` file provides default values during initial setup.

### Database Migration

```bash
npm run migrate
```

This creates the required `guild_settings`, `auth_sessions`, and `warnings` tables.

### Build & Start

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

For development with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | – | Discord bot token |
| `CLIENT_ID` | Yes | – | Discord application client ID |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | No | `CLIENT_ID` | Discord OAuth client ID for dashboard login |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | Required for OAuth | empty string | Discord OAuth client secret for dashboard login |
| `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI` | Required for OAuth | empty string | Discord OAuth callback URL |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | – | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `API_PORT` | No | `3000` | REST API port (localhost-only in production) |
| `DASHBOARD_URL` | No | `http://localhost:5173` | Dashboard URL used as the post-login OAuth redirect target |
| `SESSION_DURATION` | No | `28800000` | Dashboard session lifetime in milliseconds |
| `COOKIE_NAME` | No | `hoak_session` | HttpOnly dashboard session cookie name |
| `SESSION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL` | No | `3600000` | Session cleanup interval in milliseconds for cleanup tooling |
| `GUILD_ID` | No | from `bot.json` | Primary guild ID |
| `OWNER_IDS` | No | from `bot.json` | Comma-separated owner IDs |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | `production` | `development` or `production` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal` |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Dashboard only | `/api/v1` | Dashboard API base URL; use `/api/v1` behind the same origin/reverse proxy |

The `DATABASE_URL` expects a full PostgreSQL connection string:

```
postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

For production OAuth, configure the Discord Developer Portal OAuth2 redirect URI to exactly match `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI`. For `dashboard.hoakfamily.web.id`, the expected value is:

```text
https://dashboard.hoakfamily.web.id/api/v1/auth/callback
```

The dashboard OAuth implementation requests only the `identify` and `guilds` scopes. Sessions are stored server-side in PostgreSQL and exposed to the browser only through an HttpOnly cookie named by `COOKIE_NAME`. Use `NODE_ENV=production` in production so session cookies are marked `Secure`.

After a successful OAuth callback, the backend creates the server-side session, sets the session cookie, and redirects the browser to `DASHBOARD_URL`.

---

## Running

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the bot with `tsx watch` for auto-reload on file changes.

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or with PM2:

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/system/health
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "subsystems": {
      "config": { "status": "healthy", "message": "Configuration loaded" },
      "database": { "status": "healthy", "message": "Database connected" },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

---

## REST API

The API runs on localhost only (bound to `127.0.0.1`). All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/system/health` | Health check |
| `GET` | `/modules` | List all module manifests |
| `GET` | `/modules/:id` | Single module manifest |
| `GET` | `/modules/:id/settings` | Module settings metadata |
| `GET` | `/guilds/:guildId/modules` | Modules for a guild |
| `GET` | `/guilds/:guildId/settings` | All setting values for a guild |
| `PATCH` | `/guilds/:guildId/settings` | Update setting values |

Settings are stored per-guild in PostgreSQL. The `PATCH` endpoint validates values against registered Zod schemas before persisting. When a setting is changed, the `ConfigurationService` updates the in-memory runtime snapshot and emits a `configuration.changed` event — modules that read live config (Welcome, Goodbye) pick up the new value without restart.

---

## Dashboard

Status: **Implemented, not deployed.**

The dashboard platform is a complete React application built with Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, and Vitest. It provides:

- Module homepage with cards
- Guild switcher
- Dynamic settings forms rendered from metadata (no hardcoded forms)
- Welcome and Goodbye card configuration
- Voice, Logging, Moderation, General module settings
- Theme persistence (localStorage)
- Responsive layout

### Current status by feature

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Platform shell | Complete |
| Dynamic settings rendering | Complete |
| Backend API integration | Complete |
| Welcome/Goodbye card config | Complete |
| Theme persistence | Complete |
| Discord OAuth | Implemented for dashboard login |
| Server-side sessions | Implemented |
| Public deployment | **Blocked** (requires production reverse proxy/security hardening) |
| Nginx reverse proxy | Not configured |

### Development

For dashboard development, run the bot API and dashboard dev server simultaneously:

```bash
# Terminal 1: start the bot
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: start the dashboard dev server
npm run dashboard:dev
```

Create `dashboard/.env.local` with:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

Guild selection is loaded from the authenticated dashboard session via `GET /api/v1/me`; `VITE_GUILD_ID` is no longer used.

### Production

The dashboard is **not deployed** in production. The Vite build (`dist-dashboard/`) is generated as part of `npm run build` but no production web server is configured to serve it. The built files are static and should be served behind nginx or another reverse proxy that forwards `/api/v1` to the backend API.

Production dashboard OAuth requires:

- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` or `CLIENT_ID` set to the Discord application client ID.
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` set from the Discord Developer Portal.
- `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI` set to the exact configured OAuth2 redirect URI.
- `DASHBOARD_URL` set to the dashboard origin users should return to after login, for example `https://dashboard.hoakfamily.web.id`.
- `COOKIE_NAME` set to the desired HttpOnly session cookie name, usually `hoak_session`.
- `SESSION_DURATION` set to the desired session lifetime in milliseconds.
- `NODE_ENV=production` so session cookies include the `Secure` flag.

---

## Testing

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check backend and dashboard (0 errors enforced) |
| `npm run lint` | Lint backend and dashboard with ESLint |
| `npm run test` | Run all backend tests + dashboard tests |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Backend tests with coverage report |
| `npm run dashboard:test` | Dashboard component tests only |

Current test suite: **490 tests** (472 backend + 18 dashboard), all passing.

---

## Production Deployment

### 1. Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Compiles TypeScript to `dist/` and builds the dashboard to `dist-dashboard/`.

### 2. Migration

```bash
npm run migrate
```

Creates the `guild_settings`, `auth_sessions`, and `warnings` tables. Run once before starting the bot.

### 3. PM2

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

The PM2 config (`ecosystem.config.js`) is pre-configured with:

- `max_memory_restart: 512M`
- `max_restarts: 10`, `restart_delay: 5000`
- `kill_timeout: 15000`
- `wait_ready: true`, `listen_timeout: 20000`
- Log files in `logs/`
- `exec_mode: fork` (single instance, the bot maintains its own state)

### 4. Health monitoring

```bash
# Manual check
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/system/health

# Watch logs
pm2 logs hoakbot

# View metrics snapshot (included in health endpoint)
```

### 5. Backup

```bash
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" > hoakbot-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

Back up the `.env` file separately — it is not stored in the repository.
